Here in Washington, we have been in quarantine for a little over two months now. On March 23rd, our governor Jay Inslee issued his ["Stay Home--Stay Healthy"](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20(tmp)%20(002).pdf)[^1] order, asking people to stay at home unless they are engaged in "essential business." But you know all this already.

We've all been living in the post-COVID world and suffering under its direct and indirect impact on our lives, and there have been plenty of people who have talked about
how they are coping with things. I don't think I necessarily have more to add to the general discussion, but I do feel like it would help for me to write down my thoughts 
on how I have been succeeding and failing at being productive these days.

### Staying in
I am an introvert by nature. A weekend without having to leave the apartment (or preferably the back half of our apartment) is not only a cherished experience, but
without it I eventually begin to feel overwraught and bitter. So much of this has been a dream! I am actually required to be at home at 8pm on a Saturday and invitations 
to be sociable are limited to "click this Zoom link from the comfort of your own home." Simply spectacular.

It seems that other people have (on average) had a much more difficult time than I have to this aspect. My partner, for instance, has felt drained and stifled on many
occasions and has had to work on getting her need for socialization filled in other ways. For the most part, I have been okay.

After two months of lockdown, however, even I have had pangs for human connection. My normal attitude is towards self-preservation through getting enough time alone,
but that is no longer the problem. Now I have to work on getting myself out of this blasted apartment and out into nature and among people. 

### Getting out
When things first began, I was fairly good at getting out into nature. We live right next door to Seattle's beautiful Discovery Park which provides 
hundreds of acres of hiking trails and coasts and trees. I can go take a walk in the park there and feel very centered and connected to the world.

That is all well and good as long as I am feeling well-adjusted emotionally and have the bandwidth to recognise when I need to get outside to fill 
up my tanks. However as a person who has struggled with anxiety and depression throughout his adult life, sometimes I simply don't have that awareness 
readily at hand. This is a dangerous cycle: I start out feeling blue and like I don't want to get up and face the world. Since these days it is expected 
that people stay indoors, there is little to no social pressure to buck that trend. This just furthers the negative feelings and pushes me deeper 
into my hole.

### Being productive
Even if I am being reasonably good with my mental hygiene, however, this environment simply does not lend itself well to *getting things done*. I find myself 
sitting here at my desk desperately trying to keep myself on-task and producing at the same level as usual. And it simply does not happen. I have scheduled my 
day carefully to include breaks and designated periods of work on designated topics and while this helps me not be entirely sedentary, it doesn't help 
me get back to normal. I miss the clear delineation between home and work. I miss the quiet and focus that comes from being in my office. I miss having math students 
surrounding me to talk math about. I miss having my chalk board to scratch ideas on when I feel stuck on a problem and need to change up my perspective.

It's not all doom and gloom however. My cat Emmy is happy that I'm home all day. I am able to quickly change between working and not to allow myself to take advantage 
of energy when it comes up naturally in my day. I get to see my partner throughout the day (although we really try to give each other space while we're working).
