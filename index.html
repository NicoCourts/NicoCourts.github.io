I am a Ph.D. student at University of Washington, Seattle studying mathematics. 
I am primarily interested in representation theory, category theory, and artifical 
intelligence but I am fascinated by most aspects of math and science. At the moment 
I am simultaneously pursuing my studies in algebra (the main focus for my degree) 
along with theoretical and applied computer science courses. My eventual goal is 
to determine the best way to blend my interests in a way that is both practical and 
intellectually fulfilling.

While I have enjoyed the mentoring aspect of teaching, I have found the standard educational format a rather 
poor compromise in many ways and am interested in ways of learning and imparting 
knowledge that go beyond the standard read/lecture/test paradigm.

This has, in part, fueled my interest in data science and---in particular---ways to
present and analyze datasets in order to communicate phenomena and to aid in 
making inferences.
