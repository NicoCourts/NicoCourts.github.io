message: "Hey Alfred! Thanks for sharing. You are absolutely right that qualified immunity is a HUGE problem. I feel like this also highlights the problems with the police unions as they stand. I am generally pretty pro-union as they protect workers and work to get them better paid and supported, but in this case that works against the public interest. It is obvious why the unions would want police officers to have as much protection against punishment as possible, but doing so is at the expense of justice for the common person. And when the police already have a history of acting inappropriately with a certain group, that only shields them in their prejudice. \r\n\r\nI don't know much about the WaPo database, but I did a quick search and found the police shootings database which pretty clearly shows that black and latino people are shot at much higher rates than white people. There may be some surprising results in that data as well, but you are absolutely right: even if we were to end all police killings, that would not mean that the problem of racism had ended. This is a (horrifying and graphic) example of a much larger, pervasive, and sometimes subtle problem."
