message: "A very beautifully written reflection.  I have found myself in an odd headspace this past week and continue to wonder: How can a pattern of police brutality continue given the constitutional rights that protect us as American citizens? The answer is the principle of qualified immunity. Various Supreme Court rulings have allowed and set precedent to excuse a culture of brutality and lack of accountability. This, among other facets of this movement, is what both infuriate and energize me to continue fighting.\n\nI am also perplexed at the notion that people believe racism to be measurable and rely on \"data\" that is flawed and inaccurate. I have seen many commentators refer to a Washington Post database to refute a pattern of racism in police killings while failing to acknowledge the fine print which states that the data only tells part of the story.  It appears now that murder by police has become the only accepted measure of racism in this country."
